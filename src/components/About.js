      <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
      <p> Im Eddie, your charming honours student at the University of Waterloo studying mathematics. 
        
        with a passion for math, computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. 
        
        I pride myself in the way I strive for excellence in my learning, and I enjoy connecting and collaborating with others.

Outside of my academic life, I am also a passionate visual and musical artist. 

I look forward to working with you!</p>
